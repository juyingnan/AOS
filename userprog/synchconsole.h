// console.h
//	Data structures to simulate the behavior of a terminal
//	I/O device.  A terminal has two parts -- a keyboard input,
//	and a display output, each of which produces/accepts
//	characters sequentially.
//
//	The console hardware device is asynchronous.  When a character is
//	written to the device, the routine returns immediately, and an
//	interrupt handler is called later when the I/O completes.
//	For reads, an interrupt handler is called when a character arrives.
//
//	The user of the device can specify the routines to be called when
//	the read/write interrupts occur.  There is a separate interrupt
//	for read and write, and the device is "duplex" -- a character
//	can be outgoing and incoming at the same time.
//
//  DO NOT CHANGE -- part of the machine emulation

// Input and output to the device is simulated by reading
// and writing to UNIX files ("readFile" and "writeFile").
//
// Since the device is asynchronous, the interrupt handler "readAvail"
// is called when a character has arrived, ready to be read in.
// The interrupt handler "writeDone" is called when an output character
// has been "put", so that the next character can be written.
